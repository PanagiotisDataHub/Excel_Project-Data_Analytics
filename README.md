# Excel Data Analytics Projects  

## Introduction  
Welcome to my projects created while taking the **Excel for Data Analytics** course!  

These projects serve two purposes:  

1. To showcase my knowledge and skills in Excel for data analysis—both skills I previously had and those I gained throughout the course.  
2. To provide useful insights for workers and job seekers in the data job market, helping them understand required skills and expected compensation for different positions.  

The dataset used for this analysis comes from the [Excel for Data Analytics Course](https://youtu.be/pCJ15nGFgVg?si=skanFq232Z0CcfGg) by [Luke Barousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse) and [Kelly Adams](https://github.com/kellyjadams). This dataset includes real-life job postings from 2023 in the data job market, covering aspects such as job titles, salary averages, locations, and required skills.
